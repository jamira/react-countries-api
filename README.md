### What I learned

I'd love to share my experience working with React Query for the first time! It was definitely a fun and exciting experience, and I was amazed by how easy it made handling asynchronous data in my React applications.

One thing that stood out to me was how simple it was to handle cache with React Query. By default, React Query caches data in memory and automatically updates it when necessary. This means that if you make the same API call multiple times, React Query will only make the request once and then return the cached data for subsequent requests.

I was amazed by how easy it was to handle cache with React Query. It made my code much simpler and easier to understand, and it also made my app feel much faster and more responsive.

Overall, my experience working with React Query was really positive. It was fun and exciting to learn a new tool that made my work easier and more efficient, and I was amazed by how easy it was to handle cache. I'm looking forward to using React Query in future projects!
